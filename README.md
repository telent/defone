# (defone) - The Habitable Phone OS

Current phone operating systems treat apps as monoliths.  If you have
one app that does 80% of what you want and another that does a
different 50% of what you want, you have two apps and neither of them
meets your need.

The goal of (defone) is (eventually) to replace the monolithic app
ecosystem with small general-purpose components which can be strung
together according to user needs.  The components are written in
Clojure and talk to each other using core.async
