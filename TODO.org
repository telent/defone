* Next steps
** TODO freetype bitmaps -> gl texture

Maybe use a string->(seq of bitmap) function where each bitmap element
has the data and the h width and whatever else, and our gl glue can
consume it and copy each glyph into whatever texture it's using.

It might be simpler just to write (render-text string render-char-cb)
that calls render-char-cb for each bitmap generated.  Suspect that 
the seq *might* allow us to be more flexible with linewrap though.
Let's go with the easy route first though


** put bluetooth in arch diagram

* Stuff to tidy up
** TODO create an avahi user

Dunno why the package installation didn't do this for us.

** org mode vs <pre> ?
